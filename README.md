1. Take your discord token so you can connect the script to your discord account.
(if you need help check out this article https://www.discordtips.com/how-to-get-your-discord-token/)

2. If you want to have a custom emoji, you need to find the emoji id .Right click the emoji in chat and press
Open link, then when it opens in the browser take the id from the link.
For example https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/768389828752179200.gif?v=1 , the id would be 768389828752179200.

3. Then you can proceed to the last part where you can choose the text you want to be placed. You can have as many
lines as you want.

Hope you enjoy it.
